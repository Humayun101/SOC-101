- Mean time to detect(MTTD)
	- LOWER MTTD= FASTER DETECTION
- Mean time to resolution(MTTR)
	- Lower MTTR=MORE EFFICENT IR
- Mean time to attend and analyze (MTTA&A)
	- lower MTTA&A= reduced response latency
- Incident detection rate
	- higher rate=better visibility and monitoring
- False positive rate(FPR)
	- lower rate= more accurate detection
- False Negative rates (FNR)
	- lower rate= more accurate detection


- Key performance indicators (KPIs)
- Key risk indicators (KRIs)
- Service Level agreements (SLA)
