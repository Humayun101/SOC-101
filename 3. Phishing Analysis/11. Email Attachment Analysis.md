Refer to exercise 3.12 in course video for practical

Goal is to safety analyse email attachments
Must be done in secure environment

File hashes are the 1st step to check integrity
md5, sha1, sha256

Downloading attachment is okay for analysis as long as u don't execute it 

DidierStevens Tool suite/emldump.py= allow us to extract attachment using cli

**STEPS**
- COLLECT HASHES like sha256 
	- command = sha256sum quotation.iso
- After getting hashes, use file reputation services to verify with malware databases
	- this uses metadata, user submission etc
		- virustotal.com is open source(safer to upload hash rather than file in case file is authentic, other people can see the content)
		- ciscotalos is also another intelligence tool to search by sha256 hash of file
