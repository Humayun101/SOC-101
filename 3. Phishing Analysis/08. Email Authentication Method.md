Following are the 3 Email authentication technologies
- SPF (sender policy framework): used to authenticate DNS record of mail
	- ns lookup -type=txt shodan.io | grep -i spf
- DKIM (Domain identified Mail): used to authenticate origin of email messages
	- allow recipient to verify that email is from the person its supposed to be and message content has not been tempered
	- it does this using PKI
- DMARC(Domain-based message Authentication, reporting and conformance)
	- work in a hybrid manner of SPF and DKIM
	- it allow domain owner to apply policy on how their email should be handled

we can check that domain actually sent an email

- mstoolbox can be used to verify DKIM hash key record


these email authentication  methods are not silver bullet and they just shows the record, sometimes, spoofed email might pass these atheisation but legit might fail
