Network Traffic Analysis will have both capture and display filter capabilities
- capture filters are initial parameters we mention before monitoring, allow us to specify the type of traffic we wanna capture(protocol, IP)
- display filters are applied after the monitoring

- $tcpdump -D
- $sudo tcpdump -i {network interface}: shows us our traffic toward internet
	- converting resolving IP into host
- -n flag does not convert the IP into Hostname
- host flag shows us traffic related to specific host
	- $sudo tecpdump -i {network interface} -n host {hostname}
- src/dst filter: only shows specific IP address packets
	- $sudo tecpdump -i {network interface} -n src {IP}
- net filter only shows traffic from to and fro from specific network interface
	- useful for C2 
- port filter only shows traffic specific to a port
- logical operator help in combining multiple filters
	- <img src="Pasted image 20251016135534.png">
- TCP also allow us to filter based on protocol
	- $sudo tcpdump -i {ni} -n {protocol}

read man pages for all options 

- -w can be used to save network traffic in a pcap file
- -r can be used to read that pcap file
