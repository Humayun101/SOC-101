The concept of IPS/IDS work both proactively to Monitor and reactively to prevent intrusions into the network

	- IDS: Device or Software that monitor system Traffic for Malicious traffic or actions or Policy Violation based on predefined rules or known malware signatures or anomaly or behaviour based detection
	- Identift, Alert and report using passive monitoring and forwarded to SIEM through logs
	- Easy to Scale and implenment as they work passievly


	- IPS: More of a proactive solution designed to detect and prevent before occuration and in real time
	- can block or mitigate action  
	- blocking and dropping can be done by Traffic inspection
	- can also terminate connection
	- alert generation through logs

2 TYPES OF IDS
 **NIPS/NIDS(Network-based IDS/IPS)**
 
	 - OPERATE ON NETWORK LEVEL

 **HIPS/HIDS(Host-based IDS/IPS)**

	- operate at the endlevel or user level
	- analyze activities on host(file system, login, apps)
