- Network security principle
- network patches, flows and security controls
- packet captures
- network traffic analysis
- manage intrusion detection and prevention system
- write and implement network prevention and detection rules


____

- IP= Fundamental Comm. Internet Protocol which facilities data transmission from src. to des. and is in network layer
	- IP ADDRESSING (32 BUT BINARY)
	- IP routing= determine path of packet to traverse
- TCP= works in transport layer and is another fundamental for data comm. 
	- 3 way handshake; Connection oriented and reliable
	- flow and congestion control
- UDP
	- CONNECTIONLESS
	- low-overhead- speed over reliability means no guarantee of packet reaching dest.

- DNS resolve name it IP
	- nslookup -type=A example.com
- Ephemeral or high level port= a random port used to form connection

- Seq. Number= used to specify the seq. number to data packet
- Akc Number= Seq. Number+1
- Flags
	- ACK
	- RST
	- SYN
	- FIN

Refer to exercise 4.2 in course files for course practice

- NETCAT
	- nc -lvp 1234(server)
	- nc localhost  1234 -v

You can analyse packet using tcp-dump between client and server
- sudo tcpdump -i lo


ICMP does not use any port and sits on top of IP address
