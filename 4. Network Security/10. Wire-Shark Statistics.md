An utility within WS to analyze large pcap file and its best way to start

Statistics are available in menu bar and most important are
- capture file properties: metadata of pcap file
	- alert time == metadata info
	- change according to DF
- resolved address
	- shows all dns resolved records in pcap
- protocol hierarchy: tree of protocol with hierarchal predominant order(aggregate with DF)
- Conversations: organize comm between endpoint for patterns and seeing who was talking most to whom
- endpoints: sme thing as cut sort stuff with tcp dump
- HTTP>REQUEST

the package stream option can help us rebuild whole communication between 2 endpoints and show us pretty much everything for investigation

packet number is also a unique identifier in WS which help us navigate easily through packets
- Go>Go to packets
- we can also mark packets
	- we can apply filter for marked too like frame.marked== 1

- exporting object feature help us download any object base files like exectuables or others which were transferred via Unencrypted protocol like HTTP or FTP etc
	- file>export object

**Wireshark Analysis methodology**
refer to ex 4.11 for practical stuff

- UTC Time stamp
- leverage wireshark statistics and narrow down
- add extra columns if needed like src and des ports
-  simpler things first like HTTP
- export objects of IOC for static analysis (Malware bazaar)
	- arp and eth.dst eq ff:ff:ff:ff:ff:ff == check the whole arp scan on brodcast network
	- ICMP then ping the machine to see if they are active for arp probe within network
- SMTP
- Wire shark also make it easy for us to see files trasnfer using SMB with the same export object method
