Snort is the foremost Open Source Intrusion Prevention System (IPS) in the world managed by CISCO. Snort IPS uses a series of rules that help define malicious network activity and uses those rules to find packets that match against them and generates alerts for users.

Snort can be deployed inline to stop these packets, as well. Snort has three primary uses: As a packet sniffer like tcpdump, as a packet logger — which is useful for network traffic debugging, or it can be used as a full-blown network intrusion prevention system. Snort can be downloaded and configured for personal and business use alike.

Operate in 3 Primary Modes
- Sniffer mode== More like TCPDump
- Packet logger mode== PCAPs
- IDS/IPS mode in live Environment 
	- work on defined rules


$sudo apt Install snort: to install snort and give it the inet of your IP range

$snort --version
- run on 3 major libraries
	- libpcap= interface for user level packets capture
	- PCRE : Perl Compatible Regular Expressions , which implements a regular expression engine and PATTERN MATCHING
	- Zlib= library for compression and de-compression

**SNORT CONFIGURATION**
--
- Snort run on Promiscuous mode in typical org.
- main configuration file we need to change is in /etc/snort
	- SNORT.CONF = primary conf file
		- it is best to make a copy of it in case thing go south if we are changing conf
		- notable things in config file
			- network variable/ internal and external both
			- we can link critical IP 
			- rules path
			- Section 7: Rule set
				- to set custom rules, comment out all default first
		- to check if confi file is working after changes, run $ sudo snort -T -c /etc/snort/snort.conf
	- rules dir.= default rules on which snort run

$sudo snort -i {NI} : runs snort in packet sniffer mode like Tcpdump or wireshark
- -e argument allow us to see Protocol headers
- -d payload output in hex and ascii

$sudo snort -i {NI}  -l  {dir to save}: runs snort in packet logger mode like we used to save PCAPs
- -r used to read log file
- we can also read log file using tcp dump
