2 approaches
- packet based analysis
- flow based analysis

- PACKET
	- a piece of puzzle used to make or assemble full destination
	- consist of 3 parts
		- Headers= info of metadata for handling of data
		- Payload= contain actual data which makes up the content(might be encrypted)
		- Trailer or footer (like padding or checksum)

- PCAP
	- Intercepting packets
		- port mirroring (span ports)
		- inline network devices like IPS/IDS which take action on predefine rules
		- network taps
	- PCAP Files
		- Binary file format used to store packet data
		- header and raw payload
		- Tcpdump, wireshark, Tshark

- Flow Records= more summeraize way of capturing data
	- Aggregated metadata
	- 5-Tuple
		- Source IP
		- Source Port
		- Des. IP
		- Dest. Port
		- Transport Protocol
	- Gives a summery view while PCAP gives more details
