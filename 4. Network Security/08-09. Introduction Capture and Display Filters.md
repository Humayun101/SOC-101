GUI based utility for network troubleshooting and analysis and most widely used

It can also capture live and static pcap and advantageous over TCPdump

- For real time traffic capture on high speed network=TCPdump
- Detailed packet analysis can be resource-intense = Wireshark

**Wireshark For linux** 
- $ sudo apt install wireshark
	- for advance releases= sudo add-apt-repository ppa:wireshark-dev/stable
	- $sudo apt update
	- sudo apt install wireshark

**Wireshark For Windows**
	visit wireshark.org


 **Wireshark Guide**
- $ sudo wireshark / sudo wireshark -i {interface} -k = open wireshark
	- Menu bar and tool bar familiarity
	- Capture filter
	- <img src="Pasted image 20251101182520.png">
	- 
		- all the columns in main windows
			- we can change stamps using view in menu bar(time, details etc)
	- <img src="Pasted image 20251101182841.png">
	- 
		- 	shows detailed protocol background
	- <img src="Pasted image 20251101182949.png">
			-  shows hex output and encoded ASCII  content of data packet

- Packet Colorization help us differ packets in long dump of packets
	- CTRL+0-9 for temporary colorization
	- view>coloring rules for permanent

**Capture and Display Filters**
- Capture filter is different than display filter
	-  CF= ALLOW US TO REDUCE THE SIZE OF RAW PACKET CAPTURE= LIMITED= SET BEFORE ANALYSIS
		- host
		- port
		- src port
		- operators and or not
		- net(filter for IP range)
		- ~ host www.example.com and not (port 80 or port 25)
	- DF= HIDE SOME PACKETS FROM ALREADY ESTABLISHED FLOW= MORE FEATURES = CAN BE CHANGED ANYtIME DURING ANALYSIS
		- written in libpcap langauge which are same as tcpdump filters
			- protocol filter
			- equal filter like ip.addr== VALUE
			- <> <=>=
			- contains filter shows packet containing keywork like {http contains "login"}/ {http contains "service"}
			- more examples
				- http.request.method== "POST/GET"
				- http.request.uri contains "name"
				- dns.qry.name== "example.com"
				- tcp.port== 80
		- apply as filter/select as filter in detail pane apply for similar filters
