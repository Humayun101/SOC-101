**Investigative Way to enumerate auto start entries**

	- shows us which registry keys start at windows or when specific conditions are met
	- can help us know about various information about entry
- Auto-run powershell module

	- powershell script tool(need execution policy to be unrestricted)

*Refer to autorun practical exercises
