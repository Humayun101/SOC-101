Evaluation of task manager is a GUI option to Analyze Process of windows
- We can enable multiple Thing for transparency in Task Manager 
	- Name
	- Type
	- Publisher
	- PID
	- P-Name
	- Command line

2 Additional sys-internal tools for process monitoring and analysis
- process monitor :  troubleshooting tool that show info about file system, registry and process running
- process explorer : task manager on steroids

**Core process that are always part of Windows OS**

- System; PID=4; responsible for kernal mode thread; never have a PID
- smss.exe; windows session manager
- csrss.exe; managing console windows
- wininit.exe; Initialize all task during boot-up; session 0
- services.exe; service control manager which start, stop and control services
- svchost.exe; used to run .dll
	- Windows Spawn alot of svchost.exe which runs with the -k parameter to differentiate
	- common for a malicious instance to hide among svchost
	- absence of -k argument can be adversary
- lsass.exe; autehticting users and implementing local security policies
- winlogon.exe; manages login and logout procedures and loads user profiles(NTUSER.DAT)
- explorer.exe; provides GUI for files and system settings


**Process Investigation**

An adversary can hide the Malicious instance among these windows core processes as masquerades. So It is Important to follow a graph of Parent Child hierarchy, Root path and other information when investigating these specific processes. Following is some major thing to look for
- Parent process
- Child process
- Cli arguments; like svchost without -k
- Process name and Misspelling
- User account
- Image Path
