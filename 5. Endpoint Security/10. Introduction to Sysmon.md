Windows Event Viewer is a complicated entity to integrate with SIEM, due to size of log and useless features,  to avoid EV we can install a third party utility known as Sysmon

- Sysmon: Windows system service or device driver that monitor and logs system activity
	- Also provide details info about process creation
	- Network connection
	- Changes to file
	- Tells us Hashes of .exe running

*Sysmon is not an EDR
 
Sysinternal-Sysmon v15.14
- Consist of configuration file that define system activity and tailor sysmon behavior according to org. needs
	- 2 basline configuration files that pretty much cover everything
		- SwiftOnSecuirty/sysmon-config in GIthub
		- Olaf sysmon-modular configuration file

*Sys-mon is installed using poweshell, refer to practical exercise*
